If you'd like to help, but you're unsure where to start, see [the 'to do' section below](#To-Do) for some ideas.

Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester.git
# or ...
git clone git@github.com:IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

### 3. Make Changes

Make your changes to the code or documentation. Be sure to follow our coding style and conventions.

We use clang-format for autoformatting. If you are unable to run clang-format on your machine for whatever reason, please follow the [GNU C conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html).

Finally, if possible, prior to commiting/pushing your changes run `make full` to test the program using Valgrind first.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a feature or fix a bug"
```

### 5. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to the repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### 6. Submit a Pull Request

Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request. Provide a clear description of the changes youâ€™ve made and any additional context or information that may be helpful for reviewers.

## To Do
+ Handle SIGINT/Windows-equivalent of SIGINT gracefully
    + Currently, if a user presses `CTRL+C` while the program is executing, this causes a memory leak.
        + To see this in action, run `make test` and then press `CTRL+C`.
    + An ideal solution would free any outstanding, allocated memory and close open file handlers before exiting
    + Ideally, this solution should also be cross-platform, if at all possible.
    + Could possibly be worth converting the program to use an arena and a custom malloc just for the ease of freeing memory in a case such as this.
+ Create a guide for building the project from source for Windows users.
+ Handle interal dat file extraction from CDs without requiring game files to be copied to the user's hard drive.
