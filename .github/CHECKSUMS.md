# HarvesterHarvester (HH) Checksums

HH provides two checksums files with its releases: [old_hh_checksums.txt](old_hh_checksums.txt) and [full_output_checksums.txt](full_output_checksums.txt). One can generate a similar checksum file for the output produced by HH by running [the included 'batch-md5' utility program](../tools/batch-md5/). This utility produces a `checksums.txt` file which can then be validated against the two provided checksum files using [the 'verify-chksums' utility](../tools/verify-chksums/).

`old_hh_checksums.txt` provides md5 checksums for every file generated by v1.0.0 of HH. This file is included for development purposes, to ensure that we're not doing anything which produces wildly different results compared to previous releases.

`full_output_checksums.txt` provides md5 checksums for HH's output on my local machine. This program enables users to validate their output compared to my own. There's no reason why your output should differ from my own, but on the off chance that it does, [please open up a new issue](https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester/issues).

## Disclaimer

By default, running the aforementioned utility programs on a Windows machine will produce md5 checksum mismatches. This is (arguably) not a flaw of HH itself, but rather a side effect of Windows/NTFS file systems being case insensitive by default. See [the following issue for more details](https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester/issues/3). Additionally, users on Windows 10 and 11 should see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for details on how to enable case-sensitivity for HH.
