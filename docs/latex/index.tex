A tool for harvesting data out of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvester_(video_game)}{\texttt{ {\itshape Harvester}\textquotesingle{}s (Digi\+FX Interactive, 1996)}} dat files.

This program is the first piece of a toolchain that I\textquotesingle{}m developing as I work to reverse engineering {\itshape Harvester}. The ultimate goal of this project is to eventually port the game to a more modern graphics framework (Raylib or Open\+GL) just for fun/to teach myself the basics of reverse engineering.

The program works in two steps\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It reconstructs the original disk images that Harvester would\textquotesingle{}ve shipped with in 1996
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Note}\+: if you own the original game disks, this step is not needed.
\item See USAGE.md for more details.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item It extracts the dat files contained within those new directories in order to give you full access to all of the game\textquotesingle{}s files.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Future Projects}{Future Projects}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
The next step for me in this project will be creating an asset viewer.

This will require me to reverse engineer all of the various, non-\/standardized file formats that Digi\+FX used when making the game, which will be essential for porting the game in the future.

So far, I\textquotesingle{}ve already been able to reverse engineer the {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.BM} files, which are used for all the static backgrounds in the games, for character portraits, the map, and more. Unfortunately, I likely can\textquotesingle{}t to share these files, at least not in bulk (see below). I will, however, be sharing a small handful of these images as I show this project off online and I\textquotesingle{}ll make sure to add a link here in the future if you wish to view those!\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

Navigate to the \href{https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester/releases}{\texttt{ releases}} page and download the latest zip file. Once downloaded, simply extract the zip file and run the appropriate executable given your operating system/architecture.

If you\textquotesingle{}re on a modern Windows machine and you\textquotesingle{}re unsure of which file to run, your best bet is likely the one ending in {\ttfamily x86\+\_\+64}; that executable should run on most Windows machines made in the past 15 years.

{\bfseries{NOTE}}\+: {\itshape if you\textquotesingle{}re reading this in the present, you\textquotesingle{}ll notice that there currently aren\textquotesingle{}t any available releases. I\textquotesingle{}m writing this README in advance -- this project isn\textquotesingle{}t quite done yet, sorry!}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Building from source (Linux/\+Mac\+OS/\+Unix)}{Building from source (Linux/\+Mac\+OS/\+Unix)}}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
1) Install the following dependencies\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcc\ make\ mingw32-\/gcc\ clang-\/tools-\/extra\ valgrind\ doxygen}

\end{DoxyCode}
 2) Clone the repo\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ clone\ https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester/\ \&\&\ cd\ HarvesterHarvester}

\end{DoxyCode}
 3) Build using make\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ make\ release\ \#\ for\ *nix,\ x86\_64,\ and\ i686\ executables}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#\ ...\ or,\ alternatively\ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ make\ full\ \ \ \ \#\ for\ just\ the\ *nix\ executable}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Running {\ttfamily make release} is strongly recommended as the build process for the release target makes use of every single dependency listed above, thus ensuring that you have all the correct packages installed on your machine.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Basic Usage}{Basic Usage}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
1) Install Harvester onto your machine if you haven\textquotesingle{}t already done so. 2) Copy the following files from your harvester installation to the {\ttfamily dat-\/files/} folder\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{HARVEST.DAT}
\DoxyCodeLine{HARVEST3.DAT}
\DoxyCodeLine{HARVEST4.DAT}

\end{DoxyCode}
 4) Run the {\ttfamily Harvester\+Harvester} executable.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{A note on piracy}{A note on piracy}}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
This program requires that you legally own a copy of {\itshape Harvester} in order to source the necessary {\ttfamily .dat} files.

The GOG version (which this project was built around) \href{https://www.gog.com/en/game/harvester}{\texttt{ is available here for \$5.99}}, although it\textquotesingle{}s worth noting that it does go on sale rather often.

\href{https://isthereanydeal.com/game/harvester/info/}{\texttt{ Alternatively, visit any of the retailers on this link if you\textquotesingle{}d rather shop elsewhere}}.

This project in no way intends to encourage the piracy of Digi\+FX\textquotesingle{} software.
