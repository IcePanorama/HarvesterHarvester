A tool for harvesting data out of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvester_(video_game)}{\texttt{ {\itshape Harvester}\textquotesingle{}s (Digi\+FX Interactive, 1996)}} DAT files.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

Navigate to the \href{https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester/releases}{\texttt{ releases}} page and download the latest zip file. Once downloaded, simply extract the zip file and run the appropriate executable given your operating system/architecture.

If you\textquotesingle{}re on a modern Windows machine and you\textquotesingle{}re unsure of which file to run, your best bet is likely the one ending in {\ttfamily x86\+\_\+64}; that executable should run on most Windows machines made in the past 15 years.

{\bfseries{NOTE}}\+: {\itshape if you\textquotesingle{}re reading this in the present, you\textquotesingle{}ll notice that there currently aren\textquotesingle{}t any available releases. I\textquotesingle{}m writing this README in advance -- this project isn\textquotesingle{}t quite done yet, sorry!}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Building from source (Linux/\+Mac\+OS/\+Unix)}{Building from source (Linux/\+Mac\+OS/\+Unix)}}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
1) Install the following dependencies\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcc\ make\ mingw32-\/gcc\ clang-\/tools-\/extra\ valgrind\ doxygen}

\end{DoxyCode}
 2) Clone the repo\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ clone\ https://github.com/IcePanorama/HarvesterHarvester/\ \&\&\ cd\ HarvesterHarvester}

\end{DoxyCode}
 3) Build using make\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ make\ release\ \#\ for\ *nix,\ x86\_64,\ and\ i686\ executables}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#\ ...\ or,\ alternatively\ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ make\ full\ \ \ \ \#\ for\ just\ the\ *nix\ executable}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Running {\ttfamily make release} is strongly recommended as the build process for the release target makes use of every single dependency listed above, thus ensuring that you have all the correct packages installed on your machine.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
1) Install Harvester onto your machine if you haven\textquotesingle{}t already done so. 2) Copy the following files from your harvester installation to the {\ttfamily dat-\/files/} folder\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{HARVEST.DAT}
\DoxyCodeLine{HARVEST3.DAT}
\DoxyCodeLine{HARVEST4.DAT}

\end{DoxyCode}
 4) Run the {\ttfamily Harvester\+Harvester} executable.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{To Do}{To Do}}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Handle SIGINT/\+Windows-\/equivalent of SIGINT gracefully
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Currently, if a user presses {\ttfamily CTRL+C} while the program is executing, this causes a memory leak.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To see this in action, run {\ttfamily make test} and then press {\ttfamily CTRL+C}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item An ideal solution would free any outstanding, allocated memory and close open file handlers before exiting
\item Ideally, this solution should also be cross-\/platform, if at all possible.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Create a guide for building the project from source for Windows users.

This program requires that you legally own a copy of {\itshape Harvester} in order to source the necessary .DAT files.

The GOG version (which this project was built around) \href{https://www.gog.com/en/game/harvester}{\texttt{ is available here for \$5.99}}, although it\textquotesingle{}s worth noting that it does go on sale rather often.

\href{https://isthereanydeal.com/game/harvester/info/}{\texttt{ Alternatively, visit any of the retailers on this link if you\textquotesingle{}d rather shop elsewhere}}.

This project in no way intends to encourage the piracy of Digi\+FX\textquotesingle{} software.
